          The Dhaka Bridge, often referred to as the Bangabandhu Bridge or
          Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge, is one of the most significant
          infrastructural achievements in Bangladesh. Here’s a brief overview:
          Location: It connects the eastern and western parts of Bangladesh,
          spanning the Jamuna River. Construction: The bridge's construction
          began in 1994 and was completed in 1998. It involved a collaboration
          of international engineers and local expertise. Dimensions: The bridge
          is approximately 4.8 kilometers long, making it one of the longest
          bridges in South Asia. Purpose: The bridge serves a dual purpose. It
          supports both road and rail traffic, facilitating smoother and quicker
          transportation across the country. Additionally, it carries a gas
          pipeline, a fiber-optic cable, and an electrical interconnection line.
          Economic Impact: By significantly reducing travel time and
          transportation costs, the bridge has had a profound impact on the
          economy, boosting trade and commerce between different regions of
          Bangladesh.
